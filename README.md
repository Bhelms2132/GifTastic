# GifTastic
GifTastic is a dynamic web page that has six different topics of interest to me.  It has the ability to populate with suggested topics of interests of the user by adding a topic in the suggestion box and clicking submit button.  When clicking on one of the topics, it will populate with images related to the topic.  The user can click on the image to make the image animate then click back on the image to become still again.

## Technologies used
HTML, GHIPY API, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS
